# Getting started with Python for data analysis. 
Dataframes are 2-dimensional labeled data structures with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet. Numpy and Pandas are two very powerful and commonly used libraries used for datasets in bioinformatics. If you don't have these installed, you can get them as part of the [SciPy bundle](https://www.scipy.org/). You can also use [conda](/2019-08-06-conda) to install them individually. 

## Numpy

### Numpy is a library for arrays.
 * Helpful, lengthy explanation of indexes and slices in arrays: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/24713353](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24713353)
 * Numpy basics: [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/user/quickstart.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/user/quickstart.html) 
 * More explanation of data types (numpy): [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/user/basics.types.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/user/basics.types.html) 
 * Why do we want to use numpy vs regular python lists? [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/993984/what-are-the-advantages-of-numpy-over-regular-python-lists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/993984/what-are-the-advantages-of-numpy-over-regular-python-lists)

## Pandas

### Pandas is a python library for data frames. Understanding the basics of numpy will be helpful before getting into pandas.  
 * Pandas introduction: [http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) 
 * And another: [https://www.learnpython.org/en/Pandas_Basics](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Pandas_Basics) 
 * Selecting data in a dataframe (iloc): [https://www.shanelynn.ie/select-pandas-dataframe-rows-and-columns-using-iloc-loc-and-ix/](https://www.shanelynn.ie/select-pandas-dataframe-rows-and-columns-using-iloc-loc-and-ix/)
