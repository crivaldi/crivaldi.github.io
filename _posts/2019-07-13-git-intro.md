# Welcome.

# Everything is fine.

# Git & github links/instructions

Since we're going to be using git for the rest of the semester to turn in assignments, we should get it down pretty good now. Here's a nice explanation of git & github that uses an analogy of an author writing a book.

### Turning in assignments - only one per pair/group

1.  Complete the exercise on your local machine. Commit your changes.
2.  Push your repo to your own github repository.
3.  Go to the GitHub website and your own repository (which is a forked repo of my original repo).
4.  Use "Pull Request" to turn in your assignment (upper middle of the screen, click "New Pull Request"
5.  Make sure to type you and your collaborator's name into the text box (ex: jones-rivaldi submission).
6.  Click "Create Pull Request"
7.  Done!
