### Background

I'm a PhD candidate in the department of Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame. Before that, I did a masters in biology at the University of Texas at Tyler. Before THAT I got a BS in Biology at UT Austin. 


### Research

My research uses  population  genetics to refine known aspects  of the landscape and anthropogenic effects on the genetics of the macaque populations in Southeast Asia. I attempt to accomplish this in a few ways. First, by using the gene for the protein salivary amylase as a metric by which to study the diets of the macaques in the context of the amount of provisioning to which they are subjected. Second, I use next-generation sequencing to analyze the diversity and function, particularly in carbohydrate digestion, of the microbes present in the oral environment. Third, I use biomarkers and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the macaque genome to evaluate the overall adaptation of the communities and populations available to us in Southeast Asia. Together, these approaches will potentially allow a more complete view of the diet of primates and how environmental elements affect the response that can be reflected by the genome.


### Note for biologists learning bioinfomatics

I've had incredible opportunities that let me here, and am extraordinarily grateful to the people who provided them. One really important thing that I've learned is that very few biologists have had any sort of computational training that has prepared them adequately for the monumental onslaught of data we're currently seeing. This website and the information I share on it is intended to help make the transition easier, and I welcome any suggestions or questions about content. Please enjoy and remember that most of us out here needed a lot of help when we got started, so don't feel embarassed about something you're having trouble figuring out. Welcome to the community!
